# livespeechsummarization
This project is a **live speech summarization tool** that listens through a microphone, converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition, extracts the most frequent keywords with NLTK, and generates a simple summary of the spoken content. It helps in quickly capturing and condensing spoken information in real-time.
